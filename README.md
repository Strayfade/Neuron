## Building (Somewhat working, still complicated.)
Extra packages are required which I can't upload here, and I couldn't be bothered to learn how to use GitLFS to upload files.

Install the following packages from Nuget:
 - CefSharp.Winforms
 - EasyTabs
 - Aspose.Zip
 - DotNetZip
 - Svg
 - System.Drawing.Common
 - System.IO.Compression
 - System.IO.Compression.ZipFile
 - TitleBarTabs

# Neuron History

 - Neuron stores browsing history in an encrypted file, rather than in traditional *UI/Local Storage*  save files.
 - Enabling/Disabling History has no effect on load times or website speeds. This is because history is only saved **after** a website has finished loading.

# Viewing Browser History

**As mentioned,** Neuron browser history is stored in an encrypted file. To access this, provide the password associated with the file, and the file will be saved to a location of your choice.

 - **NOTE**: You can change where the encrypted Neuron History File is stored from the "Directory" menu in Settings.
